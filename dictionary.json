If\nnecessary to distinguish these meanings, use *email message* or *message* to refer to an individual piece of email. Make sure it's\nclear that you're not referring to instant messaging. After you\nhave established the context of electronic mail, it's OK to use *mail* instead of *email*.\n\nIt's OK to use *email* as a verb.\n\n**Global tip** In some languages, the translation of *email* is different for noun and verb forms. If you use *email* as a noun, provide enough context that localizers can identify its role in the sentence. For example, write *send an email,* which positions *email* after a verb and an article, where a noun is expected. In contrast, *Email* used by itself as a heading could be a noun or a verb. \n\nUse *Email* at the beginning of a sentence or heading. Never hyphenate *email* or capitalize the *m.*\n\n**Examples**  \nYou have two new emails.  \nScroll through email to find the message you want to read.  \nYou have new mail.  \nEmail us your comments. \n\n**See also** [message](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/m/message.md)\n"},{"words":["embed"],"content":"\n# embed\n\nUse instead of *imbed*.\n"},{"words":["emoticons","emoji"],"content":"\n# emoticons, emoji\n\nUse emoticons.

This might not be necessary for commonly used characters, such as the period (.).\n\nTo show a key combination that includes punctuation requiring use of the Shift key, such as the question mark, use *Shift* and the name or symbol of the shifted key. Using the name of the unshifted key, such as *4* rather than *$,* could be confusing or even wrong. For example, the *?* and */* characters aren't shifted keys on every keyboard. Always spell out *Plus sign, Minus sign, Hyphen, Period,* and *Comma*.\n\n**Examples**<br />Ctrl+Shift+? <br />Ctrl+Shift+\\* <br />Ctrl+Shift+Comma\n\n**See also** [Special character term collection](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/special-characters.md)\n"},{"words":["mouse and mouse interaction terms"],"content":"\n# Mouse and mouse interaction terms\n\nMost\nof the time, don't talk about the mouse, mouse actions, or the pointer\nunless it's necessary to avoid confusion.

In general use, the term often has negative connotations.<br /><br />It’s OK to use *hack* and *hacker* in content for developers or in contexts where positive outcomes are involved, such as hackathons.  <br /><br />Don’t use *hacker* to mean an amateur programmer.

For other units of measure not covered here, see [*The Chicago Manual of Style*](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).\n\n  - Use\n    numerals for measurements of distance, temperature, volume, size,\n    weight, pixels, points, and so on—even if the number is less than\n    10\\. Add a zero before the decimal point for decimal fractions less than one, unless the customer is asked to enter the value.  \n    **Examples**  \n    3 ft, 5 in.  \n    1.76 lb  \n    80 × 80 pixels  \n    0.75 grams  \n    enter **.75**\"  \n    3 centimeters  \n    3 cm\n    \n  - Insert a space between the unit of measure and the numeral, or hyphenate if the measurement modifies a noun.\n    **Examples**  \n    13.5 inches  \n    13.5-inch display  \n    8.0 MP  \n    8.0-MP camera  \n    \n  - Use\n    abbreviations only with numbers in specific measurements, such\n    as 20 MP, and don't follow the abbreviation with a period.  \n    **Exception** Follow *in* with a period when used as an abbreviation for *inch.*\n    \n  - Use commas in numbers that have four or more digits, regardless of how the numbers appear in the UI: 1,093 MB.  \n    **Exceptions**  \n    For years, pixels, and baud use commas only when the number has five or more digits: *1920 × 1080 pixels, \n    10,240 × 4320 pixels, 9600 baud, 14,400 baud.*  \n    Don’t use commas after the decimal point in decimal fractions.\n    \n  - When\n    the unit of measure is spelled out, use the singular form when the\n    number is 1. Use the plural form for all other measurements.  \n    **Examples**  \n    0 points  \n    0.5 points  \n    1 point  \n    12 points\n    \n  - Spell out *by* in dimensions, except for tile sizes, screen resolutions, and paper sizes. For those, use the multiplication sign (×). Use a space before and after the multiplication sign.  \n    **Examples**  \n    10 by 12 ft room  \n    3\" by 5\" image  \n    4 × 4 tile   \n    8.5\" × 11\" paper   \n    1280 × 1024\n\n**See also** [Bits and bytes term collection](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/bits-bytes-terms.md), [Numbers](~/numbers.md)\n\n|**Category**|**Term**|**Abbreviation and usage**|\n--|--|--|\n|**Distance and length**|centimeters|cm|\n||feet|ft|\n||inches|in.
